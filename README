cw is a colorer for command-line programs.  It is designed to be
transparent: when you type 'du', 'df', 'ping', etc. in your shell the
output is automatically colored according to a definition script, but
when the commands are used non-interactively (e.g. in another script)
their output is not colored, so as not to confuse programs that
process their output.  Text patterns are defined as lexical classes,
and assigned colors.  The arguments to the original program and OS
under which it is running can be tested.  cw includes over 50
definition scripts, and it's easy to write more.

cw is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3, or,
at your option, any later version.


Installation
------------

It is recommended to install cw using LuaRocks from
http://www.luarocks.org/ :

  luarocks install cw

Note: you must already have automake installed.

Or, you can use the GNU autotools build system directly. This requires the
stdlib and luaposix libraries (`luarocks install stdlib luaposix`)
From a git checkout:

  autoreconf -i && ./configure && make

To use cw, you need to prepend its definition directory to the PATH
environment variable.  You should do this in your shell's interactive
startup file (you don't want cw being run by background commands).
For example, for bash and other Bourne-compatible shells, add the
following line to your ~/.bashrc:

  if [ -n "$PS1" ]; then PATH=`cw-definitions-path`:$PATH; export PATH; fi

The test of $PS1 ensures that the shell is really interactive.


Use
---

Start a new shell and try some commands, which should now be colored!
See cw(1) (the cw man page) for more information, including details of
definition scripts.
